## Future Vision

In our Future Vision section, we aspire to integrate MediTrade with NearMed, a pioneering platform. NearMed empowers end-users to effortlessly compare medicine prices from nearby stores and make purchases. Leveraging Meditrade's stored store locations, users can explore medicine availability in proximity to their location. Additionally, the platform facilitates users in sending medicine purchase requests directly to shop owners via the admin panel. This synergistic integration aims to enhance user convenience and bridge the gap between medical store owners and their customers.
